                    Q: Are you sure you can/are authorised to sell Genshin Impact merchandise?

                <h3 class="answer">
                    A: There is no hard law that official/authentic items cannot be re-sold. It's fair as the items are purchased from Mihoyo's flagship store itself, meaning that the products are official and your purchases and funds will go to and through them. Furthermore, we've established ourselves as a middle man of no affiliation to them, and only serve to make your purchases fuss-free!
